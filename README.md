This guide i created while my journey for learning JavaScript, and as there many guides and cheatsheets so i decided only to focus on two things:

1- The parts that i feel it need more depth and more learning to fully understand, some will seem to you a very easy ones but for me i see a diffrent POV.

2- The Weired Parts [NaN - Undefined - truthy - Falsy - etc ........]

#I will updated the guide regulary

1- Comments:

// inline comment [a comment in the same line with the code]

/* multi
       line
           comment */

2- Varibales initial value
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined. [Source:https://www.freecodecamp.org/]

 myVar !== MYVAR

4- Constant

const = let + read-only(cannot be reassigned)

const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

---

5- let value can be changed but not re declared like:

---

6- Increment:

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the ++ operator.

i++;  is the equivalent of  i = i + 1;

Note: The entire line becomes i++;, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

---

7- Float

Decimal numbers are sometimes referred to as floating point numbers or floats.

---

8-  % === The remainder operator

The remainder operator % gives the remainder of the division of two numbers.

Example

5 % 2 = 1 because
Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
2 * 2 = 4
5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)

---

9- String Immutability


In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

Use Bracket Notation to Find the Last Character in a String

In order to get the last letter of a string, you can subtract one from the string's length.
Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

---

10- Nest one Array within Another Array

This is also called a multi-dimensional array.


---

11- Modify Array Data With Indexes

Unlike strings, the entries of arrays are mutable and can be changed freely, even if the array was declared with const.

---

12- Parameters && Arguments

Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.

---

13- Global Scope and Functions:

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

---

14- Localscope:

Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

---

15- Global && Local togather

It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.

---

16- Type Coercion:

In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does.

---

17-Strict equality (===):

Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

---

18- Switch Statements:

```
switch() {
  case //here you add the case value which is like a parameter to call it, it can be number or letter:
    block of code to check or excute;
    break;
}
```

If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which define various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

        In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.
