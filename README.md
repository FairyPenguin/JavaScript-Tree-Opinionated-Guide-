# JavaScript Tree [Opinionated-Guide]

This guide i created while my journey for learning JavaScript, and as there many guides and cheatsheets so i decided only to focus on two things:
1- The parts that i feel it need more depth and more learning to fully understand, some will seem to you a very easy ones but for me i see a diffrent POV.
2- The Weired Parts [NaN - Undefined - truthy - Falsy - etc ........]

#I will updated the guide regulary 


1- Comments:

// inline comment [a comment in the same line with the code]

/* multi
       line
           comment */
           

2- Varibales initial value
When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN which means "Not a Number". If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a string of undefined. [Source:https://www.freecodecamp.org/]
